						<h2>Obstacles</h2>
						<p>What I overcame:</p>
					</header>

					<ul>
						<li>Limited Prior Knowledge</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					Before I came to BSD Code & Design Academy, I had some prioir knowledge in HTML & CSS but not much.
					<br>
					At first, I didn't think there was any more to it than putting a few lines of code together, and poof! I have a website!
					<br>
					I was terribly mistaken... working with website templates and changing the code to make it fit my desired asctetic standard was not easy. Little did I know that working here would not only stress my logical thinking but my capability to teach as well.

						<h2>Experience</h2>
						<p>How will this propel me forward in my future?</p>
					</header>
					<ul>
						<li>confidence</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Being that I want to pursue computer science in college, I find that at this point in my life every bit of experience can only be beneficial. These past two weeks have been incredibly educational. I have learned so much from my advisors and being in the workplace. They give me their undivided attention when I need it and are perfect examples of what its like to succeed in this field. From coding to social skills to teaching, I plan to gather all of these skills to further my knowledge and succeed in the industry.

						<h2>What New Understanding</h2>
						<p>Has my essential question led?</p>
					</header>
					<ul>
						<li>Excitement/<strong>Frustration</strong></li>
						<li>Curiosity</li>
					</u>
					<p>
						These three emotions are essential to me becuase this is how I felt most of the time during my involvement at BSD. I always felt excited when my code worked correctly. Being able to put two and two together and have it work with fluidity comes with great satisfaction. On the other hand...Frustration, whether you like it or not is something that will finagele it's way into your code every once in a while. It's the curiosity that keeps you going. A common question like "why isn't this working?" pushed me to not give up.

						<h2>What I Learned</h2>
						<p>About myself</p>
					</header>

					<ul>
						<li>Coding in HTML & CSS was not as hard as I thought</li>
						<li>Teaching was not as much of an obstacle</li>
						<li>When there is a passion to learn, information is retained easier</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						In the end I found it suprising how much I was able to learn in less than two weeks. By the third day we essentially covered all the material and just built upon it from there. I proved to myself that this is the direction I want to go in.<br> While in the office I found myself relying on my advisors for help, but during my time at home I really had to figure it out myself and I learned that I have better problem solving capabilities than I originally thought.
